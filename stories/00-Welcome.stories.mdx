# Office of Advancement Component Library

This site will host the component library used in applications for the Office of Advancement at the University of Colorado.

## Storybook

The component library is displayed using a tool called Storybook.

> A Storybook is a collection of stories. Each story represents a single visual state of a component.

While design mockups can serve as 2D representations of user interfaces, they can't represent the design as the user interacts
it. Some design tools have features for prototyping interactions, but creating those prototypes is time consuming and more
importantly does not relfect the code that's being deployed.

Resources:

- Storybook Introduction - https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/
- Design Systems for Developers - https://www.learnstorybook.com/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/introduction/

## Organization

The component library is broken down into a few sections. The first two sections relate more to general information.

- **Introduction -** Some documentation about what this library is and how it should be used.
- **Design Tokens -** Information on design tokens, like colors and fonts, that are shared across all components.

The final sections [are based on Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design). Atomic Design pairs well
with Component-driven Design since you build up from the smallest components/atoms up to fully-fledged pages.

- **Atoms -** Components at their elemental state, e.g. button and form input. Not usefuly in isolation.
- **Molecules -** Groups of atomic components that form a useful whole, e.g. a search form using inputs and a button.
- **Organisms -** Combination of molecules into meaningful groups, e.g. a header that combines a logo atom with menu and search moelcules.
- **Templates -** Combinations of organisms that end up looking like a real website page.
- **Pages -** A template with actual content in it so it looks very similar to what the final application will look like.

## Writing Stories

Here is how you would add a preview of the Button component to a MDX document with one instance that uses the primary color branding
scheme and one instance that uses the secondary color scheme and is marked as disabled.

<Preview>
  <Story name="all buttons">
    <Box>
      <Button variant="primary" sx={{ mr: 2 }}>
        Primary
      </Button>
      <Button variant="button.secondary" isDisabled>
        Disabled
      </Button>
    </Box>
  </Story>
</Preview>

And here is how the story gets rendered into the actual buttons displaying the same component but in different states.

<Box sx={{ width: '400px', mx: 'auto' }}>
  <Button variant="button.primary">Primary</Button>
  <Button variant="button.secondary" isDisabled>
    Disabled
  </Button>
</Box>

## Addons

Storybook has many addons that enhance functionailty. Initially, you look at the "Canvas" which just renders the component stories
with no additional functionality.

- **Knobs -** Allows you to change properties of components and see them relfected on the rendered Canvas.
- **Story -** Shows the actual code used to generate the Canvas.
- **Actions -** Useful for making sure clicks and other interactions send the right data.
- **Accessibility -** Shows any accessibility violations using the AXE tool.
- **Design Assets -** Can embed design assets from design tools like Adobe XD and Figma.
