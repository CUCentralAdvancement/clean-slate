# Design Tokens

Design tokens are placeholders for variables that relate to your design system. CSS variabled have been around for awhile so you can
define a color, like `$black = '#000000';`, and then use it all around the codebase, like `color: $black;`, and only have to change
one line if the hex code for `$black` changes.

Instead of hard-coding in values related to parts of design, you use tokens that describe the value more semantically,
like `$color-secondary = '#000000'` and `color: $colors-secondary;`. This way you actually think of how the color is being used and
not only that it is "black".

> Before, we decided on $color-neutral-80 for a border or background with a bit of whimsy. Now, weâ€™re applying $border-hairline or a
> \$background-color-light in a thoughtful, conventional manner.

## Format and Usage

Design tokens can be shared in different formats. In this design system, we will share them as JS (JavaScript) variables. For example,
here is how colors

```JS
// shared/styles.js
export const colors = {
  // Palette
  primary: '#CFB87C', // gold
  secondary: '#000000', // black
  tertiary: '#424242',
};

// In another file.
import { colors } from '../shared/styles';
const backgroundColor = colors.primary;
```
